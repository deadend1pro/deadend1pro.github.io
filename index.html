        The 80s and early 90s were two of the most iconic eras when it came to
        the Japanese launching some of their most incredible cars, many of which
        are still conquering drift podiums across the world in the present day.
        With the ever-increasing number of enthusiasts taking advantage of
        thousands of endless miles of touge roads in Japan, and with Keiichi
        Tsuchiya at the forefront of driftingâ€™s rise to fame, the 180SX was the
        perfect chassis for reasonably-priced fun.

      <p>
        The Datsun 240Z is one of the most iconic sports cars to ever come out
        of Japan. Apart from being such an iconic car, it also put Datsun, now
        Nissan, comfortably in a league of its own and established the brand as
        a force to be reckoned with. Even today, 52 years after its release, the
        240Z is one of the most sought-after JDM classics and a surprisingly
        usable grand tourer. But what makes this handsome car stand out compared
        to the fierce competition?

      <p>
        There are few cars that come as close to perfection as the Nissan
        Skyline GT-R. The R34 is the final installation in a long line of
        Japanese excellence that endeared this vehicle in the hearts of many JDM
        enthusiasts and earned it a reputation as perhaps one of the greatest
        sports cars ever made.
